# Test Plan for ReminderManager App

## 1. Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Test Levels

- **Unit Testing**: Verify individual components, such as reminder 
creation, editing, deletion, and list management.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure that various components (reminders, 
lists, search functionality, user authentication) work together 
seamlessly.
- **System Testing**: Conduct end-to-end testing, simulating user behavior 
to validate the entire application against requirements.
- **Regression Testing**: Re-test after code changes to ensure that 
previous functionalities still work as expected.

### 1.2 Test Types

- **Functional Testing**: Validate features against requirements (CRUD 
operations, searching, list management).
- **Usability Testing**: Assess UI/UX for intuitiveness and ease of use.
- **Performance Testing**: Test the appâ€™s responsiveness and stability, 
especially when handling a large number of reminders.
- **Security Testing**: Ensure data integrity and security, particularly 
in user authentication via Firebase.

## 2. Test Environment

- **Devices**: Various Android devices with different screen sizes and API 
levels (minimum API level 28).
- **Network Conditions**: Testing under different network environments 
(Wi-Fi, Cellular, Offline).
- **Database**: SQLite for local storage testing.

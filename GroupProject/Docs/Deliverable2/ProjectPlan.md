**Authors:** Team 3

## 1 Introduction

This is a reminder app titled ReminderManager, that gives users the freedom to create a variety of reminders with the benefit of timely reminders.

## 2 Process Description
### **Activities**
***Inception:***
The inception phase is the starting point of the project. The primary goal is to establish the project's scope and feasiblitly. Certain goals must be made during this phase they include:
  * Defining the project's business case and scope.
  * Identify all the users that will interact with the system. 
  * Outline the key requirements and constraints.
  * Determine the initial project cost.
  * Identiy potential risks.

**Entrance Criteria:**
The app's purpose is to allow users to create reminders. These reminders can be stand alone specific reminders, such as "Moms Birthday, or be included as part of a list, in this case Moms Birthday can be part of the "Special Events" list. Having the ability to create reminders and to keep them organized in lists will allow the user to have a simple organization tool for daily tasks and future planning.
  * Initial Stakeholders:
    * Individual, professional and student end-users. Individual users will have a personal orginization tool to manage their tasks and appointments. Professional users will be able to keep track of meetings, deadlines and professional commitments. Student users will benefit from being reminders of assigment due dates, exams and class schedules.
  *  Sponsors of the app are Brad and Janet.
  *  Develepment Team:
     *  Project manager: Oversees the project from conception to launch, ensuring it meets its objectives.
     *  UI/UX designers: Responsible for designing the app's interface and user experience.
     *  Quality Assurance Testers: Responsible for testing the app for bugs, usablity issues, and performance problems.
     *  App designers: Responsible for design considerations such as app assumptions, constraints, system evironment, and architectural design. 
  * Business Case: The need to write down reminders with pencil and paper is a thing of the past. In a fast-paced digital world, the need for digital solutions that can assist in organizing daily routines, remembering important tasks, and planning events effectively the opportunity for a Reminder App that is more intuitive and integrated can provide a benefit for users and investors alike.
    * Benefits:
      * User productivity
      * User engagement
    * Costs:
      * Development: Cost for a team of six members to create and maintain the app.
      * 
**Exit Criteria:**
The conditions that signify the completion of this inital stage include the following approvals from Brad and Jill, the LifeCycle Objective Milestone marks the end:
  * Approved business case.
  * Project scope and vision document that clearly outlines the project's scope, vision, and objectives.

***Elaboration:***
The elaboration phase is where the project starts to take shape. The architecture of the system is defined, and the project plan is refined, the goals are the followng:
  * Analyze the problem domain and establish a sound architectural foundation.
  * Develop the project plan in more detail.
  * Eliminate high-risk elements of the project.
  * Define most use cases and any requirements.

**Entrance Criteria:**
Entrance ctiteria for the elaboration phase ensures that the project is ready to be further refined.
  * Approved Inception Phase Deliverables: Vision documents, initial risk assessment, and business case.
  * Baseline Architecture: An initial architectural framework should be available to be refined and expanded upon.
  * Initial Test Plan: A draft of the test plan that outlines how the software will be evaulated for functionality, performance, and usability.
**Exit Criteria:**
Exit criteria for the elaboration phase are a set of conditions that indicate all critical activities for this phase have been completely satisfied and the project is ready to transition to the construction phase. Exit criteria includes:
  * Baseline Architecture finalized: a stable and fully described architectural foundation for the app has been reviewed and agreed upon by the technical team.
  * Design Secifications: Detailed design document that describes UI, uder experience and system models ready for implementation.

***Construction:***
The construction phase focus is on developing the product. The goals are as followed:
  * Develop the software components and features.
  * Perform unit and integration testing.
  * Produce product documentation.
  * Prepare for deployment.

**Entrance Criteria:**
The entrance criteria of this phase ensure that the project is ready for this intensive period of building, testing, and refining the product. The criteria include:
  * Approved elaboration phase deliverables: Detailed project plan, complete requirements specification, and approved architecture documents.
  * Development environment ready: a fully configured development environment with all necessary tools, access rights, and deployment pipelines in place.
  * Detailed design documents: comprehensive design specifications that provide clear instructions for developers, including UI and system integration protocols.
  * Test plan: a detailed test plan outlining the testing strategies, test cases, and resources required for thorough testing.
  * Baseline code review: A baseline version of the code that has been reviewed and meets the standards set for moving into the construction phase.

**Exit Criteria:**
The exit criteria for the construction phase are the conditions that indicate the project's development activities that have been completed and the product is ready for the transition phase. The exit criteria include:
  * Feature completion: All planned features and functionalities are implemented and verified against the requirements.
  * Code freeze: No new features are added, and only critical bugs are addressed.
  * Testing completion: All planned testing activities, including unit, integration, system, and regression testing have been completed, and the restuls meet the predefined acceptance criteria.
  * Defect resolution: all critical and major defects identified during testing have been resolved and any remaining minor defects are documented and prioritized for future updates.
  * Performance benchmarks met: performance benchmarks set out in the requirments, such as load times and responsiveness.
  * User Acceptance Testing (UAT): UAT has been successfully completed with a select group of end-users, and any feedback has been incorporated or documented for future iterations.
  * Release candidate: A release candidate version of the app is ready and has passed all checks to be a viable candidate for production.
  * Quality Assuarance Sign-Off: QA team has signed off on the app's quality, confirming that it meets the established quality standards.

***Transition:***
The transition phase is the final phase of the USD process where the system is deployed to the user community and adjustments are made. The goals are the following:
  * Beta testing the system to validate it against user expectations.
  * Train the end-users and maintainers.

### 2.1 Development Process

We will be following an Agile methodology, leveraging Scrum. This approach allows 
us to frequently review and adjust our work based on regular feedback, ensuring 
alignment with the project goals.

### 2.2 Milestones

- **Milestone 1:** Requirements gathering and analysis - End of Week 2
- **Milestone 2:** Design phase completion - End of Week 4
- **Milestone 3:** Development phase (50% features) - End of Week 6
- **Milestone 4:** Complete all feature development - End of Week 8
- **Milestone 5:** Testing and bug fixes - End of Week 10

### 2.3 Risk Management

Risks are potential obstacles that might derail our project timeline or the 
quality of our deliverables. We've identified the following major risks:

1. **Scope Creep:** The addition of more features than initially planned can delay 
the project.
2. **Technical Debt:** Skipping best practices for quick wins might lead to a more 
problematic system in the future.
3. **Resource Unavailability:** Team members falling sick or being unavailable.

Mitigation strategies will include regular check-ins to ensure scope alignment, 
code reviews to maintain quality, and resource backups for critical roles.
